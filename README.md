- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aureyoboss !
- ðŸ‘€ I have been programming games / software since the age of 8 (games on Thomson TO7). I first learned to program in Basic (TO7, MO5, GW-Basic, Amstrad...). Then, Turbo Pascal and finally HTML / CSS / JavaScript and Flash. Since 2017, I have been programming with Qt (C ++ and QML). With Qt, I created a lot of software (DauReMi, AMIS, WebRadioPlayer, NESSMG, BatiSoft, Dolphin Slide Player, games and ArcadeFlashWeb)...
